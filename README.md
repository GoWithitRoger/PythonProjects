This script automates latent semantic analysis processing and recording of entities and topics, from MS Word documents in a local directory, using Open Calais, into  a Google Sheet.

* Documents should be in .docx format and on your local machine, or at least accesible locally
* The now drepecated (I think) Open Calais API is used. The new Open Calais may need to be used
* There are a couple pieces of personal information that must be enetered into the script prior to running: your Open Calais API, and your Google email address and password
